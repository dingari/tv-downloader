# tv-downloader

This project was inspired by the µTorrent RSS auto-download feature. I've used it with good results for a long time, but recently it's been missing out and I've had to manually search and download specific episodes.

The main reason I started this project was for fun (and convenience). I know it's not inventing the wheel and other solutions exist (Sickbeard etc).

I don't know why µTorrent has been failing to download shows, wheter it lies in the actual program or the RSS feed is not updating correctly. I've added a web-scraper to go along, but that may not be needed and may be removed.

### TODOS:
* Email/Slack notifications upon starting/completing a download.
* Track downloads (see issue #2 for more details)
* ~~Rename destination files in proper format and add episode title~~
* GUI (eventually)
